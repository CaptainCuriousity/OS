1) load a.out with strace
2) why's amount of syscalls so big?

execve - execute program
change data segment size
access - access a connection on socket

3) sys call to write "Hello world" (its syscall write)
4) what is write?

write gets file descriptor (int fd), buffer (void*), and size_t count.
0 is stdin, 1 is stdout, 2 is stderr.

5) use write instead of printf - done

6) обёртку

7) strace wget kernel.org. Get statistics of syscalls used by child process
