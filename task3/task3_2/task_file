Create a program, that:
r - "redirect"
first char: c - create, s - show, d - delete, r - redirect
second char - d - directory, f - file, s - symbolic link, h - hard link, r - rights
a. creates folder				-cd
b. list everything what lies in folder		-sd
c. delete folder (recursively)			-dd
d. create file					-cf
e. show everything in file			-sf
f. delete file					-df
g. create symbolic link on file			-cs
h. show whats in symbolic link			-ss
i. show whats in file (from symbolic link)	-rs
j. delete symbolic link on file			-ds
k. create hard link on file			-ch
l. delete hard link on file			-dh
m. show amount of hard links and rights on file	-sr
n. change rights				-cr

things like mkdir, rmdir, etc are syscalls

The sticky bit (S_ISVTX) on a directory means that a file in that
directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the
file, by the owner of the directory, and by a privileged process.

inode is a structure that stores metadata about file - rights, name, etc...
dentry - direction entry - is a representation of direction in linux

dentry, inode, etc..

there's a good function perror, what does it do?
perror is a function that prints system errors based on variable errno

test on /proc/[PID]
Tested: can list dir
