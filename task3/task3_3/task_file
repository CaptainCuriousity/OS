Write a program that prints /proc/[pid]/pagemap

What is pagemap?
Quote from kernel.org: pagemap is a set of interfaces which give userspace programs an opportunity to 
examine the page tables and related info by reading files in /proc

This file shows mapping of each of the process's virtual pages into physical page frames or swap area
It contains one 64 bit value for each page:

Bit	What means
63 	if set, page is present in RAM
62	if set, page is present in swap space
61	if set, page is file-mapped or a shared anonymous page
60-58	zero
57	write-protected via userfaultfd
56	page is exclusively mapped
55	soft-dirty ()
54-0	If the page is present in RAM (bit 63), then these
        bits provide the page frame number, which can be
        used to index /proc/kpageflags and
        /proc/kpagecount.  If the page is present in swap
        (bit 62), then bits 4–0 give the swap type, and
        bits 54–5 encode the swap offset.

The soft-dirty is a bit on a PTE which helps to track which pages a task
writes to. In order to do this tracking one should

Bits 0-54 page frame number (PFN) if present
Bits 0-4 swap type if swapped
Bits 5-54 swap offset if swapped
Bit 55 pte is soft-dirty (see Documentation/admin-guide/mm/soft-dirty.rst)
Bit 56 page exclusively mapped (since 4.2)
Bits 57-60 zero
Bit 61 page is file-page or shared-anon (since 3.5)
Bit 62 page swapped
Bit 63 page present
